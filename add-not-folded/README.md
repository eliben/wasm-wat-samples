Trivial WASM function that adds two numbers together and returns the result.

It's useful as a basic demonstration of loading and invoking WASM from a host,
as well as a starting point for new samples.

This sample is just like `add`, but it doesn't use folded instructions, using
a linear sequence of stack-manipulation instructions instead.
